In order to run BactSNP with default settings, execute the following command:  
  bactsnp -q [fastq_list] -r [reference.fasta] -o <output directory>

Options:  
  -h | --help
    Show help message.
  -v | --version
    Show version information.
  -q | --fastq_list FILE (either or both of -q and -a is required)
    TSV file to specify the name and the pair of read-data files (FASTQ) of each
    isolate. When you have multiple FASTQ files for each strand, concatenate
    them into one file. Users can input gzipped FASTQ files, but their
    extensions need to be '.gz' in that case. See others/fq_list_format.
  -r | --reference FILE
    FASTA file of the reference sequence.
  -o | --out_dir STR (required)
    Name of output directory.
  -j | --jobs INT (default: 1)
    Number of concurrent jobs, i.e. number of isolates processed concurrently.
  -t | --thread INT (default: 1)
    Number of threads in platanus_trim, platanus, bwa mem, and samtools sort.
  -a | --fasta_list FILE (either or both of -q and -a is required)
    TSV file to specify the name and the assembly-data file (FASTA) of each
    isolate. Use this option when you do not have read data for some isolates.
    BactSNP simulates sequence reads from the input assembly and use them in the
    same way as the real sequence data. See others/fa_list_format.
  --ref_strain STR
    Name of a taget isolate used as a reference. BactSNP de novo assembles the
    genome of the specified isolate and uses it as the reference genome.
  --mask_region FILE
    TSV file to specify the region where you want to avoid calling SNPs. See
    others/input_region_format.
  --dist_from_indel INT (default: 5)
    If distance from the nearest indel is this value or smaller, an ambiguous
    allele is called.
  --allele_freq FLOAT (default: 0.9)
    If allele frequency is smaller than this value, an ambiguous allele is
    called.
  --depth INT (default: 10)
    If coverage depth is smaller than this value, an ambiguous allele is called.
  --no_clean
    If this option is specified, BactSNP does not remove intermediate files.
  
Outputs:
  pseudo_genome/
    Directory containing pseudo-genome files (FASTA) of input isolates. Each
    position in each contig corresponds to the same position in the same contig
    of the reference genome (i.e. Insertions of each isolate are ignored and
    sites corresponding to deletions of each isolate are represented as '-').
    Ambiguous sites are also represented as '-' (see the description of
    --dist_from_indel, --allele_freq, and --depth).
  pseudo_genomes_wo_ref.fa
    FASTA file reporting pseudo genomes of input isolates. For each isolate, all
    contigs in pseudo_genome/${isolate}.fa are concatenated into one sequence.
  pseudo_genomes_w_ref.fa
    Same as pseudo_genomes_wo_ref.fa except that the reference genome is
    appended.
  snps_wo_ref.tsv
    TSV file reporting SNPs among the input isolates. SNPs are detected using
    pseudo genomes in pseudo_genome/. Positions are 1-based.
  snps_w_ref.tsv
    TSV file reporting SNPs among the input and reference isolates. SNPs are
    detected using pseudo genomes in pseudo_genome/ and the reference genome.
    Positions are 1-based.
  replaced_pseudo_genome/
    Directory containing pseudo-genome files (FASTA) of input isolates (the way
    of generatng pseudo genomes is different from pseudo_genome/). Each pseudo
    genome is generated by replacing the reference sequence according to
    snps_wo_ref.tsv. (Nucleotides are replaced at sites where nucleotides of all
    isolates are unambiguous in snps_wo_ref.tsv, and nucleotides at the other
    sites remain unreplaced.
  replaced_pseudo_genomes_wo_ref.fa
    FASTA file reporting pseudo genomes of input isolates. For each isolate, all
    contigs in replacd_pseudo_genome/${isolate}.fa are concatenated into one
    sequence. This file is the suitable input to phylogeny analysis software.
  replaced_pseudo_genomes_w_ref.fa
    Same as replaced_pseudo_genomes_wo_ref.fa except that the reference genome
    is appended. This file is also the suitable input to phylogeny analysis
    software.
  bactsnp_out
    Text file reporting commands executed in BactSNP.
  bactsnp_err
    Text file reporting error messages from BactSNP.
  assembly_results/
    Directory containing assembled contig files (FASTA) for each isolate.
  mapping_results/
    Directory containing read-mapping files (BAM) for each isolate.
    PCR-generated duplicates are removed in them.
  tmp/
    Directory including intermediate files. This directory is output only when
    you specify --no_clean.
